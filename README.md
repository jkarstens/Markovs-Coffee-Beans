Markovs-Coffee-Beans
====================

Applet to test and illustrate the result of a certain Markov chain.

Here is the question: You have a coffee can which contains an amount of black beans and an amount of white beans. Select two beans at random. If they are the same color, remove them both and place a black bean in the can. If they are different colors, remove the black bean and return the white bean. What can you deduce about the color of the last bean as a function of the inital number of black and white beans?
The applet provides visual picking of beans from a can (available at very fast speeds) and a pie chart visualization of the proportion of black and white beans remaining in the can. Applet help is available, as well as the answer and explanation to the question, available by clicking buttons on the applet. The user may choose a random number of beans or pick an exact amount of black and white beans to test hypotheses.
